# Overview

A deep learning library focused on graph representation learning for real-world chemical tasks.

- ‚úÖ State-of-the-art GNN architectures.
- üêç Extensible API: build your own GNN model and train it with ease.
- ‚öóÔ∏è Rich featurization: powerful and flexible built-in molecular featurization.
- üß† Pretrained models: for fast and easy inference or transfer learning.
- ‚Æî Read-to-use training loop based on [Pytorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/).

## Documentation

Visit https://valence-discovery.github.io/goli/.

## Installation

Use either [`mamba`](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) or [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge goli
```

or pip:

```bash
pip install goli
```

## Quick API Tour

```python
import goli

# TODO: show a quick snippet of goli that:
# - build a model and train it
# - or load a model and do inference.
```
