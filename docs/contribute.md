## Installation for developers

### For CPU and GPU developers

Use [`mamba`](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba), a preferred alternative to conda, to create your environment:

```bash
# Install Graphium's dependencies in a new environment named `graphium`
# If on a Windows machine, use `env_windows.yml` instead of `env.yml`
mamba env create -f env.yml -n graphium

# Activate the mamba environment containing graphium's dependencies
mamba activate graphium

# Install Graphium in dev mode
pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e .
```

## Build the documentation

You can build and serve the documentation locally with:

```bash
# Build and serve the doc
doxygen Doxyfile
mkdocs serve
```
