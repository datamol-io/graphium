# @package _global_
#
# For running a hyper-parameter search, we use the Optuna plugin for hydra.
# This makes optuna available as a sweeper in hydra and integrates easily with the rest of the codebase. 
# For more info, see https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/optuna_sweeper/
#
# To run a hyper-param search, 
#   (1) Update this config, specifically the hyper-param search space;
#   (2) Run `graphium-train +hparam_search=optuna` from the command line.


defaults:
  - override /hydra/sweeper: optuna
  # Optuna supports various sweepers (e.g. grid search, random search, TPE sampler)
  - override /hydra/sweeper/sampler: tpe

hyper_param_search: 
  # For the sweeper to work, the main process needs to return
  # the objective value(s) (as a float) we are trying to optimize. 

  # Assuming this is a metric, the `objective` key specifies which metric. 
  # Optuna supports multi-parameter optimization as well. 
  # If configured correctly, you can specify multiple keys.
  objective: loss/test

  # Where to save results to
  # NOTE (cwognum): Ideally, we would use the `hydra.sweep.dir` key, but they don't support remote paths.
  # save_destination: gs://path/to/bucket
  # overwrite_destination: false

  # Run in multirun mode by default (i.e. actually use the sweeper)
